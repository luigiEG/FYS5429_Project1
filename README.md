Codes and report for the first project in FYS5429 for Marta Corioni, Luigi Ernesto Ghezzer and Francesco Pogliano.

This report studies the performance of FFNNs, PINNs and RNNs on a damped harmonic oscillator system, and the Lorenz attractor.

An analysis can be read in the report Adv_ML.pdf, and the jupyter notebooks in src/DHOscillator_analysis.ipynb and src/Lorenz_analysis.ipynb sum up and go through most of the analysis.
